      <h2>Things I Enjoy</h2>
      <h3>Fencing</h3>
      <p>I'm an amateur fencer. More specifically, I practice <em>HEMA</em>, which stands for Historical European Martial Arts. Currently, I'm studying the German longsword tradition as laid down by historic masters, including Johannes Liechtenauer and Joachim Meyer. I'm also dabbling in Napoleonic saber based on texts by British duelist Charles Roworth. My primary goal is to become tournament-ready by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>I'm a proud member of my local club: <a href="https://sdswordfighters.com" target="_blank">San Diego Swordfighters</a>. If it interests you, consider checking it out!</p>

      <h3>Video Gaming</h3>
      <p>I enjoy a variety of video games, including role-playing, open-world, turn-based, strategy, and roguelike games. Here are a selection of games I absolutely recommend.</p>
      <review>
        <h4>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</h4>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Action RPG</p>
        <p>The sequel to a game I quickly fell in love with, it is a immersive RPG set in 1403 Bohemia. It masterfully combines open-world RPG elements with a strong narrative, telling a story of grief, vengeance, and acceptance. The setting is strong, but the gameplay is not easy, especially for a beginner.</p>
        <p><em>Rating:</em> ★★★★☆</p>

        <h4>Cyberpunk 2077</h4>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Action RPG</p>
        <p>The latest open-world RPG I've played</p>
        <p><em>Rating:</em> ★★★★★</p>

        <h4>Hollow Knight</h4>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Metroidvania</p>
        <p>Tough but fair, hauntingly beautiful, and deeply atmospheric. A modern classic.</p>
        <p><em>Rating:</em> ★★★★☆</p>
